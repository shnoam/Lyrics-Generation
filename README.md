# Lyrics-Generation with Melody Integration
Description:
This project focuses on generating song lyrics using RNN architecture, with the integration of melody features. The goal is to create a model that can generate coherent and musically relevant lyrics based on input seed words and melody features.

Features:
Lyrics Generation: The core functionality of the project involves generating song lyrics using deep learning models trained on existing song dataset, given by instructor.

Melody Integration: Melody features extracted from MIDI files are incorporated into the lyrics generation process to enhance the relevance and coherence of the generated lyrics.

Evaluation Metrics: Various evaluation metrics such as cosine similarity, BLEU score, subjectivity, and polarity are used to assess the quality of the generated lyrics.

Experimentation: The project facilitates experimenting with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and feature extraction methods to optimize the lyrics generation process.
